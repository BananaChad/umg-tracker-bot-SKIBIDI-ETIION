# Things to do for this project/fork

## QOL improvements

- [ ] Try merging dumper and app.js in one file, makes development environment less cluttered and adds for one .env file instead of editing code to add client tokens, webhooks etc. HIGH PRIORITY

- [ ] expand upon .env so that no webhook or token leaks are exposed to people who self-hosted the bot

## new features

- [ ] add that the tracker pings the specific user upon finding a rarity thats set to => the rarity that is set (ex. 100M)
