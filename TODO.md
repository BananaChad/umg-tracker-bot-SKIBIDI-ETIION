# Things to do for this project/fork

## QOL improvements

- [X] merging dumper and app.js in one file, makes development environment less cluttered and adds for one .env file instead of editing code to add client tokens, webhooks etc. HIGH PRIORITY
- [X] expand upon .env so that no webhook or token leaks are exposed to people who self-hosted the bot
- [ ] make an INSTALL.md so people know how to use it
- [ ] convert everything to / commands

## new features

- [ ] add that the tracker pings the specific user upon finding a rarity thats set to => the rarity that is set (ex. 100M)
